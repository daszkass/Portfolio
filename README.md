# Daria Sobolewska
Throughout my career, I have mainly worked in the area of customer service, including the last three years as a casino dealer. This experience allows me to feel confident in skills such as **communication** (both in English and Polish) and **problem-solving**. For almost three years, I also held the position of president of the dance group association (in which I also danced), thanks to which I feel confident both in **management** and in **teamwork**. I have recently decided to radically change my career path, looking for a profession that will enable me to develop myself. And hence the decision to try my hand as a software tester. In this portfolio, I would like to share my testing knowledge that I have gathered since I made this decision. I am a very **fast learner** and - most importantly - I **like to learn**, so I believe that this portfolio will grow quickly.
